### Features include

**Simplicity**: Pretty Chat works out of the box. No messing about with configurations and settings windows. In a future update, configuration will be available but completely optional.

**Colorful Text**: Express yourself like never before with Pretty Chat's support for colored text and emojis. Add a splash of color to your messages during epic battles or lighthearted role-playing sessions.

**Addon Compatibility**: Pretty Chat seamlessly integrates with other popular World of Warcraft addons, ensuring that your chat remains beautiful and functional no matter what other enhancements you use.

### How it works

Pretty Chat does not do any sort of parsing of chat messages, instead it overrides the format of [GlobalConstants.lua](https://www.townlong-yak.com/framexml/live/GlobalStrings.lua) and changes the formatting of those strings. Because of this, it should work out of the box for the default Blizzard interface or any sort of UI package such as ElvUI.

### What is not supported ... yet

For now, this addon only works with the Retail version of WoW, but adding Classic and Classic Era support is on the TODO list.
